  brief: Experienced software engineer who builds and maintains production
    services at scale, prioritizing security, reliability, and developer
    productivity. I take ownership of ambiguous problems from discovery through
    delivery, write tested, reliable code, and collaborate to improve engineering
    workflows. I learn new languages and stacks quickly, and bring a proven track
    record modernizing CI/CD, hardening security, and mentoring teammates.

    highlights:
      - Work on a Linux-focused development team supporting on-device agents
        used by thousands of customers; focus on reliability and secure
        operation in the field.
      - |
        Lead CI/CD modernization efforts: migrate agent test tooling to the uv-based
        toolset, reconfigure functional tests to run on self-hosted runners, and
        enable decommissioning of legacy VPN-based infrastructure to improve
        security and reduce developer wait time.
      - Implement agent and customer security hardening measures, including
        obfuscating TOTP seeds and rotating previously unencrypted connect
        keys to remove plaintext fallbacks and reduce attack surface.
      - Embed SQL migrations into the on-device agent to improve upgrade
        resilience and reduce field incidents during rollouts.
      - Drive improvements to Go CI tasks and linters to increase code quality
        coverage and consistency across services.
      - Streamline onboarding by improving internal developer tooling and
        documentation; mentor engineers and provide design guidance that
        shortens ramp-up time and reduces friction for cross-team work.
      - Use AWS-hosted Kubernetes environments and container tooling for
        backend development and local testing workflows.

    highlights:
      - Founded and grew a Linux-focused development team within a rapidly
        scaling product organization to support client devices across multiple
        distributions.
      - Expanded platform support to new major distributions (including Oracle
        Linux 9 and Rocky 9) and maintained compatibility with evolving kernel
        and distro changes.
      - Improved multi-distro development workflows by introducing static
        compilation techniques and build automation (Zig/static builds) to
        reduce release complexity.
      - Implemented and maintained the on-device agent written in Go with gRPC
        and protobuf for backend communication; integrated with MongoDB and
        PostgreSQL backends.
      - Authored automated functional tests in Python for end-to-end validation
        of agent behavior in CI, increasing confidence in releases.
      - Rapidly ramped in Go and became a go-to reviewer for Go code quality and
        best practices; regularly provided guidance that accelerated teammates'
        progress.
      - Used Docker Compose for local development and collaborated with teams
        using Kubernetes for backend deployments.
